# Random-Password-Generator

This is my first python project that gives the user a random password that will have a size or length based on the input of the user. I made this for myself because I always have a hard time forming good passwords, so I coded this to help me form strong random passwords. I decided to also put it out even if it is my first projects.

Hope it helps!
